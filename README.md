# Harry Potter ETL
MyProject is a .NET 9 solution following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It includes a WebAPI for exposing endpoints, a WorkerService for background job processing using Hangfire, and a Vue.js frontend written in TypeScript for data visualization. The solution integrates with the Harry Potter API as a data source and uses EFCore.
